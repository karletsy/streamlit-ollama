# Chatbot with Llama 3

Build the container using

`docker build -t streamlit-ollama .`

Some of this is available at [Abvijay's website](https://github.com/abvijaykumar/ollama-langchain) from [his blog](https://abvijaykumar.medium.com/ollama-build-a-chatbot-with-langchain-ollama-deploy-on-docker-5dfcfd140363).

Next steps are to run [RAG](https://abvijaykumar.medium.com/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-with-llamaindex-1828ef80314c) with vector indices, called LlamaIndex.
